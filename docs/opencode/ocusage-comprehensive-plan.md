      await trackToolStart(tool, args);
    },
    "tool.execute.after": async (tool, result) => {
      await trackToolComplete(tool, result);
    },
    "session.created": async (session) => {
      await trackSessionStart(session);

```

### Production Deployment

```typescript
// SST deployment configuration
export default {
  config() {
    return {
      name: "ocusage",
      region: "us-east-1",
