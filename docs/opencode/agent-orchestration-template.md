```
Multiple agents work with shared base context, results aggregated.

### Pattern 3: Layered Context Validation
```
Agent A → Context → Validator → Validated Context → Agent B
```
Context validation between agent handoffs.

Agent A → Decision → [Context Path A, Context Path B] → Respective Agents
```
Context routing based on decision points.
