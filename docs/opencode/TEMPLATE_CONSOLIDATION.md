# Template Consolidation Summary

## What Was Done

**Date**: August 15, 2025

Consolidated three separate orchestration template files into a single unified template system.

## Files Consolidated

### Source Files (Archived):
- `agent-orchestration-template-unified.md` → `docs/archive/`
- `agent-orchestration-template-bmad.md` → `docs/archive/`

### Destination File (Enhanced):
- `agent-orchestration-template.md` ← **Primary unified template**

## Key Improvements

### 1. Unified Structure
- **Progressive Complexity**: Basic → Standard → BMAD (Enterprise)
- **Clear Selection Guide**: Matrix-based template selection
- **Consistent Formatting**: Unified structure across all patterns

### 2. Enhanced Features
- **Context Chaining Patterns**: Four distinct context management approaches
- **Comprehensive Checkpoint Framework**: User, Quality, Stakeholder, and Risk checkpoints
- **Self-Reflection Framework**: Structured reflection templates and triggers
- **Selection Matrix**: Clear decision tree for template selection

### 3. Complete Coverage
- **Basic Patterns** (1-3 steps): Simple workflows with minimal overhead
- **Standard Patterns** (4-8 steps): Enhanced workflows with quality gates
- **BMAD Patterns** (9+ steps): Enterprise workflows with comprehensive validation

### 4. Practical Implementation
- **Domain-Specific Recommendations**: Security, Performance, Integration, etc.
- **Risk-Based Selection**: Low, Medium, High risk pattern recommendations
- **Best Practices Integration**: Context management, quality assurance, risk management

## Template Selection Quick Reference

| **Complexity** | **Steps** | **Risk** | **Pattern** | **Features** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Basic | 1-3 | Low | Simple Sequential/Parallel | Minimal overhead |
| Standard | 4-8 | Medium | Enhanced with Quality Gates | Validation layers |
| BMAD | 9+ | High | Enterprise with Checkpoints | Full governance |

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Eliminated Confusion**: Single source of truth for orchestration patterns
2. **Reduced Maintenance**: No more duplicate content across multiple files
3. **Enhanced Capabilities**: Full BMAD integration with basic patterns
4. **Better User Experience**: Clear selection guidance and consistent structure
5. **Future-Proof**: Extensible structure for new patterns and agent capabilities

## Migration Impact

### For Alpha Agent:
- Now has access to full range of orchestration patterns in one location
- Clear selection criteria for choosing appropriate complexity level
- Enhanced context chaining and checkpoint capabilities

### For Plan Mode:
- Simplified template selection process
- More sophisticated workflow planning capabilities
- Better integration between basic and enterprise patterns

### For Users:
- Clearer understanding of available orchestration options
- Better guidance on when to use which pattern
- More predictable workflow structures

## Archive Location

Archived templates remain available at:
- `docs/archive/agent-orchestration-template-unified.md`
- `docs/archive/agent-orchestration-template-bmad.md`

These files are preserved for reference but should not be used for new implementations.

## Next Steps

1. **Update Agent Prompts**: Ensure alpha and plan agents reference the unified template
2. **Test Implementation**: Validate new template structure with actual workflows
3. **Gather Feedback**: Collect user feedback on the new unified approach
4. **Iterate**: Refine based on real-world usage patterns
