# Command Line UI Enhancement and Java Configuration Fixes

## Issues Resolved

### 1. ‚úÖ **Fixed nvim-java Mason Registry Conflict**

**Problem:** 
- Mason registry API conflict causing startup errors
- Error: `attempt to index local 'location' (a function value)`
- nvim-java plugin failing to load due to Mason registry conflicts

**Solution:**
- Simplified nvim-java configuration to avoid Mason API conflicts
- Disabled auto-install features that were causing registry issues
- Added proper error handling with `pcall` for safe plugin loading
- Reduced dependencies on advanced nvim-java features to focus on stability

**Key Changes:**
- Removed complex Mason registry overrides
- Disabled auto JDK installation
- Simplified verification settings
- Added graceful fallback for missing dependencies

### 2. ‚úÖ **Enhanced Command Line UI**

**Problem:**
- Basic command line interface lacking visual enhancement
- No floating input UI for better user experience
- Limited command-line editing capabilities

**Solution:**
- Added **noice.nvim** for beautiful floating command line interface
- Enhanced command-line editing with better navigation
- Added **nvim-spectre** for advanced search and replace UI

## New Features Added

### üé® **Enhanced Command Line (noice.nvim)**

**Floating Command Interface:**
- Beautiful rounded borders for command input
- Centered floating window for better focus
- Enhanced visual feedback for different command types
- Better integration with completion systems

**Command Types Supported:**
- `:` - Regular vim commands with floating input
- `/` and `?` - Search with enhanced visual feedback  
- `!` - Shell commands with special formatting
- `lua` - Lua commands with syntax highlighting
- `help` - Help commands with proper icons

**Key Features:**
- **Floating popup** for command input instead of bottom line
- **Visual command type indicators** (icons for different command types)
- **Enhanced notifications** replacing basic vim.notify
- **Better LSP integration** with progress indicators

### üîç **Advanced Search & Replace (nvim-spectre)**

**Modern Search Interface:**
- **Project-wide search and replace** with live preview
- **Regex support** with real-time validation
- **File filtering** by patterns and types
- **Safe replacement** with confirmation steps

**Key Mappings:**
- `<leader>ss` - Toggle search & replace interface
- `<leader>sw` - Search current word under cursor
- `<leader>sw` (visual) - Search current selection

**Advanced Features:**
- **Live preview** of all matches across project
- **Selective replacement** (choose which matches to replace)
- **Multiple engines** (ripgrep, sed) for different use cases
- **Case sensitivity toggle** and other search options

### ‚å®Ô∏è **Enhanced Command Line Navigation**

**Better Editing:**
- `<C-a>` - Go to beginning of command line
- `<C-e>` - Go to end of command line
- `<C-f>` - Move cursor right
- `<C-b>` - Move cursor left
- `<C-d>` - Delete character
- `<C-h>` - Backspace
- `<C-k>` - Kill line from cursor to end

**Improved User Experience:**
- Floating command input reduces visual clutter
- Better focus with centered command interface
- Enhanced readability with proper spacing and borders

## Technical Implementation

### **noice.nvim Configuration**
```lua
-- Floating command line with rounded borders
cmdline = {
  enabled = true,
  view = "cmdline_popup",  -- Floating popup instead of bottom line
  -- ... format configuration for different command types
}

-- Enhanced positioning and styling
views = {
  cmdline_popup = {
    position = { row = 5, col = "50%" },  -- Centered floating position
    size = { width = 60, height = "auto" },
    border = { style = "rounded", padding = { 0, 1 } },
  }
}
```

### **nvim-spectre Configuration**
```lua
-- Advanced search with ripgrep backend
find_engine = {
  ['rg'] = {
    cmd = "rg",
    args = { '--color=never', '--no-heading', '--with-filename', '--line-number', '--column' },
    options = {
      ['ignore-case'] = { value = "--ignore-case", icon = "[I]", desc = "ignore case" },
      ['hidden'] = { value = "--hidden", desc = "hidden file", icon = "[H]" }
    }
  }
}
```

### **Java Configuration Simplified**
```lua
-- Minimal setup to avoid Mason conflicts
java.setup({
  root_markers = { 'pom.xml', 'build.gradle', '.git' },
  jdk = { auto_install = false },  -- Avoid Mason conflicts
  verification = {
    invalid_mason_registry = false,  -- Disable problematic checks
  },
})
```
