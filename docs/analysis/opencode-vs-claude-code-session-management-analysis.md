# OpenCode vs Claude Code: Session Management and Cache Architecture Analysis

## Executive Summary

This analysis compares the fundamental differences between OpenCode and Claude Code session management and caching mechanisms, building on our previous research showing that both tools share the same Claude subscription allocation. The key finding is that **architectural differences in session persistence, cache implementation, and multi-session support create the workflow optimization benefits** rather than capacity multiplication.

## Research Context

### Previous Analysis Context
- **Shared Allocation Discovery**: Both OpenCode and Claude Code use the same 900-message Claude subscription allocation
- **Workflow vs Capacity**: Benefits come from enhanced access methods, not additional capacity
- **Team Scenario**: 5-person development team optimizing Claude Code Max 20x usage

### Current Investigation Focus
Understanding the technical architecture differences that create workflow optimization benefits between:
- **OpenCode**: Go-based LSP-integrated multi-session client
- **Claude Code**: Node.js-based terminal-native agentic tool

## Session Management Architecture Comparison

### OpenCode Session Architecture

#### Session Characteristics
```
Session Model: Persistent Multi-Session
- Session IDs: `ses_7afd3b3e3ffeP2csKGgvNdFB8p` format
- Session Persistence: Survives application restarts
- Multi-Session Support: Multiple concurrent sessions
- Session Boundaries: ~200K token limits per session
- Cross-Session Sharing: Independent session contexts
```

#### Session Logging Format
```json
{
  "tokens": {
    "input": 75748,
    "output": 603,
    "cache": {
      "write": 0,
      "read": 75288

### Strategic Recommendations

For development teams with Claude Code Max 20x subscriptions:
- **Recognize configuration system sophistication**: Both tools offer comprehensive configuration management with different approaches
- **Leverage OpenCode** for structured workflows requiring modes, agents, and AI-driven cache optimization
- **Utilize Claude Code** for simplified memory management, terminal integration, and enterprise observability
