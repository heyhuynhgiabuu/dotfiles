### Core Philosophy
**"Everything is Context Engineering"** - Success depends on intentional context management, not just better prompts or tools.

---

## 📊 Compliance Analysis: Guideline by Guideline

### 1. ✅ Provide Necessary Context

**xAI Guideline:** "Provide the necessary context... specify relevant file paths, project structures, or dependencies"

**OpenCode Implementation:**
```yaml
context_layers:
  global_context:
    - opencode/AGENTS.md (operational protocol)
    - project guidelines (project-specific constraints)

  task_context:
    - current request scope and boundaries
    - agent routing decisions and rationale
    - active constraints and dependencies

  active_context:
    - immediate working memory (≤2000 tokens)
    - current agent focus and execution state
    - real-time progress and decisions
```

**Compliance:** ✅ **FULL** - 3-layer context architecture with structured boundaries

---

### 2. ✅ Set Explicit Goals and Requirements

**xAI Guideline:** "Clearly define your goals... avoid vague prompts"

**OpenCode Implementation:**
```yaml
routing_decision_tree:
  1. security_classification:
     condition: "Contains auth/config/secrets/permissions"
     action: "→ security agent (immediate, bypass planning)"

  2. complexity_threshold:
     condition: "≥3 steps OR unknown scope OR multi-phase"
     action: "→ orchestrator/plan agent"

  3. domain_specialization:
     condition: "Database/frontend/legacy systems"
     action: "→ specialist agent"
```

**Compliance:** ✅ **FULL** - Binary decision trees ensure explicit task assignment

---

### 3. ✅ Continual Refinement

**xAI Guideline:** "Take advantage of rapid iteration... refine your query"

**OpenCode Implementation:**
```yaml
context_compaction_checkpoints:
  phase_3: "Context cleanup after pre-existing tech analysis"
  phase_6: "Context refinement before implementation synthesis"
  phase_9: "Context distillation post-implementation"
  phase_12: "Final context compression for handoff/documentation"

compaction_strategies:
  information_filtering: "Remove noise, preserve architectural signal"
  progressive_summarization: "Compress previous phases into key decisions"
  context_boundaries: "Clear scope limits per agent interaction"
```

**Compliance:** ✅ **FULL** - Built-in refinement checkpoints at every workflow phase

---

### 4. ✅ Agentic Tasks

**xAI Guideline:** "Use for agentic-style tasks rather than one-shot queries"

**OpenCode Implementation:**
```yaml
agent_capability_matrix:
  security_agent:
    capabilities:
      - "Zero secret exposure: audit config files, auth flows, API keys"
      - "Least privilege validation: permission escalation, access controls"
    output_format: "Threat assessment + remediation steps + audit trail"

  language_agent:
    capabilities:
      - "Code optimization: performance patterns, algorithmic improvements"
      - "Refactoring: SOLID principles, design patterns, maintainability"
    output_format: "Code changes + test strategy + rollback plan"
```

**Compliance:** ✅ **FULL** - Specialized agents for different task domains

---

### 5. ✅ Native Tool Calling

**xAI Guideline:** "Use native tool-calling instead of XML-based outputs"

**OpenCode Implementation:**
```yaml
intelligent_tool_selection:
  discovery_first_pattern:
    1. glob: "Pattern-based file discovery (fastest, broad scope)"
    2. grep: "Content-based discovery (targeted, regex patterns)"
    3. serena_find_symbol: "Code structure discovery (precise, symbol-aware)"
    4. read: "Context boundary analysis (detailed, line-aware)"

  modification_hierarchy:
    1. edit: "Precise anchor-based changes (safest, reversible)"
    2. bash+sed: "Pattern replacements (cross-platform, batch)"
    3. write: "Full file creation/rewrite (last resort)"
```

**Compliance:** ✅ **FULL** - Native tool integration (bash, read, edit, write, grep, glob)

---

### 6. ✅ Detailed System Prompts

**xAI Guideline:** "Be thorough... describe task, expectations, edge-cases"

**OpenCode Implementation:**
```yaml
objectives:
  - Context Assessment: Analyze information complexity and context requirements first
  - Architecture: Concise analysis with precise code references and context boundaries
  - Context Engineering: Implement progressive context refinement and compaction
  - Planning: Break down complex tasks using context-aware agent delegation
  - Synthesis: Combine results into unified response with clean context handoffs

critical_constraints:
  - NEVER recommend new dependencies without explicit justification
  - ALWAYS assess context complexity before execution or delegation
  - ALWAYS implement context compaction at workflow checkpoints
  - ALWAYS delegate domain expertise to specialized agents with focused context
  - NEVER bypass security escalation protocols
```

**Compliance:** ✅ **FULL** - Comprehensive system definition with clear objectives and constraints

---

### 7. ✅ Structured Context Introduction

**xAI Guideline:** "Use XML tags or Markdown... mark various sections"

**OpenCode Implementation:**
```yaml
# YAML-structured agent definitions
---
name: security
description: >-
  ALWAYS use this agent for rapid security audits of backend code and
  configuration files, focusing on identifying common vulnerabilities...
mode: subagent
model: github-copilot/gpt-5-mini
temperature: 0.1
max_tokens: 4000
tools:
  bash: false
  edit: false
  write: false
  patch: false
---

# Markdown-formatted system documentation
## CONTEXT ENGINEERING FRAMEWORK
### Hierarchical Context Architecture
### Progressive Context Refinement
```

**Compliance:** ✅ **FULL** - YAML agent definitions + Markdown system documentation

---

### 8. ✅ Cache Optimization

**xAI Guideline:** "Maintain consistent prompts... avoid cache misses"

**OpenCode Implementation:**
```yaml
structured_reasoning:
  sequential_thinking: "Multi-step analysis with revision capability for complex problems"
  use_cases:
    - complex_architecture_decisions: "Break down system design choices with iterative refinement"
    - context_engineering_analysis: "Structure context assessment and compaction strategies"
    - cross_platform_planning: "Plan compatibility solutions with course correction"
    - problem_diagnosis: "Systematic troubleshooting with branching investigation paths"

  implementation:
    - start_simple: "Begin with initial assessment, expand thoughts as needed"
    - revise_freely: "Mark thoughts as revisions when understanding deepens"
    - branch_alternatives: "Explore multiple solution paths when uncertainty exists"
    - verify_solutions: "Generate and validate solution hypotheses"
```

**Compliance:** ✅ **FULL** - Consistent reasoning patterns across all interactions

efficiency_standards:
  token_efficiency: "Maximize information density per token"
  decision_speed: "Minimize steps to optimal solutions"
