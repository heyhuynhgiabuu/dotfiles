**Goal**: User feedback driven improvements
- **Features**: Homework management, multi-child support, document uploads
- **Scope**: Enhanced scheduling, tutor verification, family features
- **Success**: Improved user engagement and retention

### Phase 3: Business (Weeks 11-14) 💰
**Goal**: Scale revenue and operational efficiency  
- **Features**: Group sessions, family pricing, advanced analytics
- **Scope**: Premium features, business intelligence, communication tools
- **Success**: Revenue growth and operational optimization

### Phase 4: Advanced (Weeks 15+) 🚀
**Goal**: Competitive advantage through AI and compliance
- **Features**: AI matching, predictive analytics, full GDPR compliance
- **Scope**: Market differentiation, third-party integrations
- **Success**: Market leadership and scalable platform

## Quick Reference

### User Roles
- **Admin**: System oversight, tutor verification, financial management
- **Parent (Client)**: Book sessions, track progress, manage payments  
- **Tutor**: Set availability, deliver sessions, track earnings

### Core Business Model
**Subject** → **Level** → **Session** → *(Homework in Phase 2+)*
- Individual 1-hour sessions with session-based billing
- Platform takes 20% commission, tutors receive 80%
- Focus on GCSE and A-Level subjects initially

### Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Spring Boot + Gradle + MySQL + JDBC
- **Frontend**: Thymeleaf + Bootstrap + HTMX
- **Payments**: Stripe Checkout
- **Deployment**: Docker + AWS

## Development Priorities

### Week 1-2: Foundation
Focus on authentication and basic CRUD operations

### Week 3-4: Core Features  
Build the essential booking and session management

### Week 5-6: Payment & Polish
Integrate Stripe and complete the end-to-end flow

### Post-MVP: Iterate
Use real user feedback to prioritize Phase 2 features

## Key Success Factors

1. **Start Simple**: MVP with minimal features that work perfectly
2. **User Feedback**: Test early and often with real users
3. **Iterative Enhancement**: Add complexity gradually based on demand
4. **Technical Quality**: Maintain high code quality for future scalability
5. **Business Focus**: Always prioritize features that drive user value and revenue
