## Strategic Model Allocation Impact

### Model Distribution Analysis (Optimized Configuration)

| Model | Cost Factor | Usage % | Effective Capacity | Virtual RPM |
|-------|-------------|---------|-------------------|-------------|
| **GPT-4.1** | 0x (free) | 70% | ∞ conversations | 1,008/month |
| **Gemini 2.5 Pro** | 0.25x | 25% | 4x efficiency | 360/month |

### Virtual Cost Calculations

**Standard GitHub Copilot Pattern:**
- 300 conversations/month at 1x premium cost = 300 premium requests consumed
- Effective cost per conversation: 100%

**Optimized OpenCode Pattern:**
- 1,440+ conversations/month at 0.17x premium cost = 245 premium requests consumed  
- Effective cost per conversation: 8.5%
- **Cost reduction: 91.5% per conversation**

#### Standard VS Code GitHub Copilot
```
Morning session:   3 conversations (90% premium allocation)
Afternoon session: 4 conversations (120% premium allocation) ⚠️
Evening session:   3 conversations (90% premium allocation)
Total: 10 conversations/day = 300/month (plan limit reached)
```

#### Optimized OpenCode Configuration
```
Daily mode (GPT-4.1):
  - Code editing & debugging:     20 conversations (0 premium cost)
  - Quick questions & docs:       15 conversations (0 premium cost)
  
Enhanced mode (Claude Sonnet 4):
  - Complex architecture:         2 conversations (2 premium requests)
  - Security & code reviews:      1 conversation (1 premium request)

Build mode (Gemini 2.5 Pro):  
  - DevOps & deployment:          6 conversations (1.5 premium requests)

## Session Optimization Mechanics

### Cache Efficiency Multipliers (Based on Observed Data)

| Session Type | Cache Hit Rate | Effective Cost | Session Length | Capacity Multiplier |
|--------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|-------------------|
| **Documentation** | 97% | 3% of nominal | 8-12 messages | **11.2x** |
| **Code Review** | 85% | 15% of nominal | 6-8 messages | **5.1x** |
| **Development** | 60% | 40% of nominal | 4-6 messages | **2.8x** |
| **Average** | 80% | 20% of nominal | 6.8 messages | **3.2x** |

### Virtual Token Processing

**Standard Pattern (VS Code):**
- 300 requests × 200k tokens = 60M tokens/month
- No cache optimization = 60M processed tokens
- Session boundary: 1 request = 1 conversation

**Optimized Pattern (OpenCode):**
- 1,440 conversations × 200k tokens = 288M virtual tokens/month  
- 80% cache efficiency = 58M processed tokens/month
- Session boundary: 1 request = 6.8 conversations average

**Virtual token multiplier: 4.8x capacity for 97% of processing cost**
