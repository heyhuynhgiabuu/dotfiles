## Key Design Principles:
1. **Much more spacing** between all elements
2. **Alpha Agent is the largest** and most prominent
3. **Clean horizontal rows** instead of cramped vertical stacking
4. **Consistent sizing** within each row
5. **Clear section titles** for each layer
6. **Professional colors** with good contrast
7. **Minimal text** - only essential information

## Result:
A clean, professional diagram that's easy to read and understand, perfect for presentations.
