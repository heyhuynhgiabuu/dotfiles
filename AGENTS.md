# Dotfiles Project Guidelines

This file provides essential, supplementary context for the `dotfiles` repository. These guidelines work in conjunction with the global rules found in `opencode/AGENTS.md`.

- **Project Type:** Personal configuration files (dotfiles). There are no build, lint, or automated test commands.
- **Primary Requirement:** All configurations MUST be cross-platform (macOS & Linux).
- **Commit Message Rule:** Do NOT include "Generated with opencode" or any AI attribution in commit messages.
- **Verification:** All changes require simple, manual verification steps to be provided to the user.
- **Dependencies:** Do not add new software dependencies without explicit permission.
