# OpenRouter Integration - Successfully Completed

## Status: ✅ WORKING PERFECTLY

OpenRouter has been successfully integrated as an additional provider to complement GitHub Copilot.

## Key Achievements
- **Authentication**: Properly configured via `opencode auth login`
- **Configuration**: Added to `opencode/opencode.json` without API key (managed by auth system)
- **Testing**: Both simple queries and complex coding tasks work correctly
- **Documentation**: Created comprehensive guide at `docs/openrouter-integration.md`

## Working Model
- Primary model: `qwen/qwen3-coder:free`
- Usage: `opencode run -m qwen/qwen3-coder:free "prompt"`

## Verification Results
- ✅ Auth stored correctly (`opencode auth list` shows OpenRouter)
- ✅ Model responds to math questions
- ✅ Code generation works (tested with Python fibonacci function)
- ✅ File operations functional
- ✅ All free OpenRouter models visible in `opencode models`

## Benefits Achieved
- Cost conservation for GitHub Copilot premium requests (300/month via Education)
- Access to diverse model families for different use cases
- Reliable fallback when GitHub Copilot unavailable

## Final Configuration
```json
"provider": {
  "openrouter": {
    "models": {
      "qwen/qwen3-coder:free": {}
    }
  }
}
```

No further troubleshooting needed - integration is complete and functional.
