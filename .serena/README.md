# .serena directory (project metadata)

Purpose:
- Store non-secret Serena-related local metadata and onboarding artifacts.

Notes:
- Do NOT store credentials or tokens in this directory.
- This project includes opencode/serena-integration for the canonical integration content.
- Use .serena for local caches, backups and non-sensitive artifacts only.

Example structure:
- .serena/onboarding.json (already present in repo top-level .serena/configs/)
- .serena/backups/ (local backups, optional)
