## Context Engineering: Conversation Synthesis for $ARGUMENTS

**Reference**: @opencode/prompts/beta.md - "Everything is Context Engineering" philosophy

### Context Synthesis Framework

**Analysis Target**: Progressive context refinement and architectural signal preservation

#### **Context Complexity Assessment**
- **Signal/Noise Ratio**: Identify architectural decisions vs implementation noise
- **Context Boundaries**: Scope limits for current and future agent interactions
- **Security Context**: Assess context exposure and security implications
- **Agent Handoff Points**: Prepare filtered context for specialized agents

#### **Hierarchical Context Preservation**

##### **Global Context (Architectural Signal)**
- **Key Technical Decisions**: Architecture choices with rationale and constraints
- **Security Implications**: Security considerations and context exposure risks
- **Cross-Platform Constraints**: macOS/Linux compatibility requirements
- **Dependency Decisions**: Minimal dependency principle adherence

##### **Task Context (Current Scope)**
- **Agent Routing Decisions**: Which agents were used and why
- **Active Constraints**: Current limitations and boundaries
- **Implementation Context**: Files modified with architectural impact
- **Context Compaction Points**: When refinement cycles occurred

##### **Active Context (≤2000 tokens)**
- **Immediate Next Steps**: High-priority actions with context scope
- **Blockers**: Context-related impediments and resolution paths
- **Agent Delegation Readiness**: Prepared context transfers for specialized work

#### **Context Engineering Quality Gates**
- ✅ **Architectural Signal Preserved**: Technical decisions documented with rationale
- ✅ **Context Noise Filtered**: Implementation details vs architectural information separated
- ✅ **Security Context Protected**: No sensitive context exposure identified
- ✅ **Clean Agent Handoffs**: Specialized context prepared for future delegations
- ✅ **Progressive Refinement**: Context compaction checkpoints established

### Output Format
**Context-Engineered Summary**: Structured for immediate workflow continuation with clean context boundaries and optimized agent delegation readiness.
