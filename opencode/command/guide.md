Create development guide (AGENTS.md) for $ARGUMENTS with comprehensive project guidelines and agent instructions.

Analyze the codebase and create or improve AGENTS.md file containing build/lint/test commands, code style guidelines, imports, formatting, types, naming conventions, and error handling patterns.

Check for existing Cursor rules (.cursor/rules/ or .cursorrules) or Copilot rules (.github/copilot-instructions.md) and incorporate them into the AGENTS.md file.

Establish clear project context including type, goals, and requirements. Define the main workflow loop for consistent agent interactions with proper development guidelines.

Provide manual verification steps to confirm AGENTS.md file quality and ensure development guide is properly established for continued development.
