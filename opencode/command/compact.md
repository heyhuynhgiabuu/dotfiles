## Context Engineering: Progressive Conversation Compaction

**Reference**: @opencode/prompts/beta.md - "Everything is Context Engineering"

### Context Assessment for $ARGUMENTS

**Analysis Scope**: Current conversation context complexity and refinement requirements

### Context Compaction Checkpoints

1. **Context Complexity Assessment**:
   - Signal/Noise Ratio: [Architectural decisions vs implementation details]
   - Context Drift Detection: [Focus boundary violations]
   - Information Architecture: [Layer by relevance and scope]

2. **Progressive Context Refinement**:
   - **Information Filtering**: Remove noise, preserve architectural signal
   - **Progressive Summarization**: Compress previous phases into key decisions
   - **Context Boundaries**: Clear scope limits for continued work
   - **Relevance Ranking**: Prioritize by architectural impact and security implications

3. **Context Quality Metrics**:
   - **High Signal**: Focused, relevant, actionable architectural information
   - **Low Noise**: Minimal irrelevant details, no context pollution
   - **Clear Boundaries**: Well-defined scope for next agent interactions
   - **Security Context**: Security implications and context exposure assessment

### Structured Context Engineering Output

#### **Context Layer Analysis**
- **Global Context**: Preserved architectural decisions and constraints
- **Task Context**: Current scope, agent routing decisions, active dependencies  
- **Active Context**: Immediate working memory (≤2000 tokens for handoff)

#### **Technical Context Preservation**
- **Architecture Decisions**: Key technical choices and rationale
- **Security Implications**: Context exposure, security considerations
- **Implementation Context**: Files modified, configuration changes
- **Dependencies**: Cross-platform constraints, dependency decisions

#### **Agent Handoff Preparation**
- **Context-Aware Routing**: Which agents for next phases
- **Filtered Context Transfer**: Minimal, focused context per agent
- **Clean Context Boundaries**: Scope limits for specialized interactions

#### **Next Steps with Context Management**
- **Immediate**: High-priority actions with context scope
- **Context Compaction Points**: When to perform next refinement cycle
- **Agent Delegation**: Context-filtered handoffs to specialized agents

### Context Engineering Quality Gates
- ✅ Architectural signal preserved, noise filtered
- ✅ Security context assessed and protected
- ✅ Context boundaries clearly defined
- ✅ Agent handoff contexts prepared
- ✅ Progressive refinement checkpoints identified

**Output Format**: Context-engineered summary optimized for continued workflow with clean agent handoffs and minimal context pollution.
