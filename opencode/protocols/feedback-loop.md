# Feedback Loop Protocol

## Purpose
This protocol enables agents to self-improve based on user interactions, performance logs, and feedback. It fosters continuous learning and adaptation, making agents smarter over time.

## Guidelines

### 1. Feedback Collection
- Collect user feedback (e.g., positive/negative ratings, suggestions) after interactions.
- Log successes and failures from task completions.
- Use structured formats for consistent data capture.

### 2. Analysis and Adjustment
- Analyze feedback patterns to identify areas for improvement.
- Adjust behaviors dynamically (e.g., via memory storage or configuration updates).
- Prioritize changes based on impact and frequency.

### 3. Implementation and Monitoring
- Integrate feedback loops into agent workflows.
- Monitor improvements through metrics (e.g., response accuracy, user satisfaction).
- Ensure changes align with safety and ethical guidelines.

### 4. Documentation and Iteration
- Document feedback-driven changes for transparency.
- Iterate based on new data and user input.
- Escalate significant issues to human oversight.

## Integration with Other Protocols
- Combine with Advanced Reasoning for hypothesis validation based on feedback.
- Use Event Schema to log feedback events.
- Reference in Quality Tooling for performance tracking.

## Example Workflow
1. **Interaction**: Complete a user query.
2. **Feedback**: Collect user rating and comments.
3. **Analysis**: Identify improvement areas (e.g., response speed).
4. **Adjustment**: Update agent behavior accordingly.

## Benefits
- Continuous self-improvement.
- Better user satisfaction.
- Adaptive and resilient agents.
