# Technical XML Handling Protocol

## Purpose
This protocol standardizes XML handling for tool calls, focusing on structural validation, error recovery, and best practices. It ensures reliable interactions without enforcing specific tag formats, promoting technical integrity and compatibility.

## Guidelines

### 1. Structural Validation
- Validate XML structure before processing tool calls.
- Check for well-formedness, proper nesting, and required elements.
- Use automated tools or scripts for validation where possible.

### 2. Error Handling and Recovery
- Implement automated recovery for malformed XML (e.g., missing tags, invalid characters).
- Log errors with context for debugging.
- Provide fallback mechanisms, such as retrying with corrected XML.

### 3. Best Practices
- Ensure compatibility with tool call standards and OpenCode requirements.
- Prioritize technical integrity over rigid formatting.
- Document XML schemas or expected structures for reference.

### 4. Integration and Monitoring
- Integrate with Event Schema for logging XML-related events.
- Monitor for common issues (e.g., encoding problems, namespace conflicts).
- Update protocols based on recurring errors.

## Integration with Other Protocols
- Combine with Advanced Workflows for error recovery in multi-step processes.
- Use Context Management to preserve XML state across sessions.
- Reference in agent prompts for consistent XML handling.

## Example Workflow
1. **Tool Call**: Generate XML for a search query.
2. **Validation**: Check structure and fix any issues.
3. **Recovery**: If malformed, correct and retry.
4. **Outcome**: Successful, reliable tool execution.

## Benefits
- Reduced tool call failures.
- Improved system reliability.
- Easier debugging and maintenance.

## Manual Verification Checklist
- [ ] XML is structurally valid before use.
- [ ] Error recovery mechanisms are in place.
- [ ] Best practices are followed.
