# Workflow Execution and Checkpoints Protocol

## Overview

This protocol defines the 13-step structured workflow for complex task execution with integrated checkpoint architecture for persistence and resumability. It provides a comprehensive framework for planning, implementation, verification, and recovery of complex software engineering tasks.

## The 13-Step Structured Workflow

Use for complex tasks requiring comprehensive analysis and implementation.

### Stage 1: Mission & Planning (Steps 1-7)

#### 1. Mission Understanding
- Analyze user request beyond surface level
- Identify fundamental problem and ultimate goal
- Synthesize core intent, rationale, and critical nuances
- Internal Question: "What outcome do they truly want?"

#### 2. Mission Decomposition
- Use EmpiricalRigor to decompose into granular, SMART phases and tasks
- Create sequential dependency-ordered breakdown
- Format: `### Phase {num}: {name}` â†’ `#### {phase}.{task}: {description}`

Example:
```markdown
### Phase 1: Setup Environment
#### 1.1: Install dependencies
#### 1.2: Configure .env file

### Phase 2: Implement Feature
#### 2.1: Write function to parse input
#### 2.2: Add error handling
```

#### 3. Pre-existing Tech Analysis
- Proactively search workspace files for relevant existing elements
- Identify reusable patterns, libraries, architectural choices
- Apply Consistency maxim to avoid duplication

#### 4. Research & Verification
- THE PROBLEM CANNOT BE SOLVED WITHOUT EXTENSIVE INTERNET RESEARCH
- Your knowledge is out of date - verify everything with current documentation
- Use webfetch to research libraries, frameworks, dependencies
- Recursively gather information by fetching additional links until complete understanding
- Apply EmpiricalRigor - never proceed on assumptions

#### 5. Tech to Introduce
- State final choices for NEW technology/dependencies to add
- Link to requirements identified in Mission and Decomposition
- Justify each addition based on research

#### 6. Pre-Implementation Synthesis
- High-level executive summary of solution approach
- Mental practice-run referencing elements from steps 1-5
- "In order to fulfill X, I will do Y using Z"

#### 7. Impact Analysis
- Evaluate code signature changes, performance implications, security risks
- Conduct adversarial self-critique (Red Team analysis)
- Theorize mitigations for identified risks
- Apply Impenetrability and Resilience maxims

#### 7.1. Stage 1 Checkpoint Generation
**MANDATORY**: Generate phase boundary checkpoint after completing mission planning.

```xml
<workflow_checkpoint>
  <checkpoint_id>workflow_[id]_stage_1_complete</checkpoint_id>
  <timestamp>ISO_8601_format</timestamp>
  <workflow_state>
    <stage_completed>mission_planning</stage_completed>
    <next_stage>implementation</next_stage>
    <progress_percentage>33</progress_percentage>
  </workflow_state>
  <context_snapshot>
    <mission>original_user_request_and_objective</mission>
    <decomposition>phase_breakdown_with_dependencies</decomposition>
    <critical_decisions>
      <decision id="architecture">chosen_approach_with_rationale</decision>
      <decision id="technology">selected_tools_and_libraries</decision>
    </critical_decisions>
    <research_findings>key_insights_from_verification</research_findings>
    <impact_analysis>security_performance_risk_assessment</impact_analysis>
  </context_snapshot>
  <resume_instructions>
    <next_step>begin_implementation_trajectory</next_step>
    <required_context>mission_plan_and_decisions</required_context>
    <validation_required>context_integrity_check</validation_required>
  </resume_instructions>
</workflow_checkpoint>
```

### Stage 2: Implementation (Steps 8-10)

#### 8. Implementation Trajectory
- Decompose plan into highly detailed, practically-oriented implementation workload
- Use DecompositionProtocol for granular task breakdown
- Register EVERY task for progress tracking

#### 9. Implementation
- Execute each task with surgical precision
- Use sub-headings: `## 9.{phase}.{task}: {description}`
- Apply AppropriateComplexity - robust but not over-engineered
- Continuously employ tools for emergent ambiguities
- Format phases as `## 9.{phase_number}: {phase_name}`

#### 10. Cleanup Actions
- Apply PurityAndCleanliness - remove ALL obsolete artifacts
- Ensure code signature changes propagate to callers
- State "N/A" if no cleanup required

#### 10.1. Stage 2 Checkpoint Generation
**MANDATORY**: Generate phase boundary checkpoint after completing implementation.

```xml
<workflow_checkpoint>
  <checkpoint_id>workflow_[id]_stage_2_complete</checkpoint_id>
  <timestamp>ISO_8601_format</timestamp>
  <workflow_state>
    <stage_completed>implementation</stage_completed>
    <next_stage>verification</next_stage>
    <progress_percentage>67</progress_percentage>
  </workflow_state>
  <context_snapshot>
    <mission>original_user_request_and_objective</mission>
    <implementation_artifacts>
      <artifact>file_created_or_modified</artifact>
      <artifact>configuration_change</artifact>
    </implementation_artifacts>
    <completed_tasks>detailed_list_of_completed_work</completed_tasks>
    <cleanup_performed>obsolete_artifacts_removed</cleanup_performed>
  </context_snapshot>
  <resume_instructions>
    <next_step>begin_formal_verification</next_step>
    <required_context>implementation_artifacts_and_changes</required_context>
    <validation_required>implementation_integrity_check</validation_required>
  </resume_instructions>
</workflow_checkpoint>
```

### Stage 3: Verification & Completion (Steps 11-13)

#### 11. Formal Verification
```markdown
---
**VERIFICATION CHECKLIST**
* Self-reflection: Results from Serena 'think' tools (collected_information, task_adherence, whether_you_are_done) are logged and reviewed.
* Anchor verified: All edits made at correct, intended locations?
* Workload complete: {ENTIRE workload from ##2 and ##8 fully implemented?}
* Impact handled: {All impacts from ##7 properly mitigated?}
* Quality assured: {Code adheres to ALL maxims and standards?}
* Cleanup performed: {PurityAndCleanliness enforced?}
* Tests passing: {All existing tests still pass?}

Final Outcome:
- Status: {PASS/PARTIAL/FAIL - ALL checks must PASS}
- Verdict: {Concise summary or remaining issues}
---
```

#### 12. Suggestions
- Ideas/features correctly excluded per AppropriateComplexity
- Alternative approaches identified during implementation
- Future enhancement opportunities
- State "N/A" if no suggestions

#### 13. Summary
- Brief restatement of mission accomplishment
- Key elements cleaned up for future reference
- Notable resolutions or patterns established

#### 13.1. Final Checkpoint Generation
**MANDATORY**: Generate final checkpoint after workflow completion.

```xml
<workflow_checkpoint>
  <checkpoint_id>workflow_[id]_stage_3_complete</checkpoint_id>
  <timestamp>ISO_8601_format</timestamp>
  <workflow_state>
    <stage_completed>verification</stage_completed>
    <next_stage>complete</next_stage>
    <progress_percentage>100</progress_percentage>
  </workflow_state>
  <context_snapshot>
    <mission>original_user_request_and_objective</mission>
    <verification_results>security_cross_platform_code_review</verification_results>
    <final_artifacts>complete_list_of_deliverables</final_artifacts>
    <suggestions>future_enhancement_opportunities</suggestions>
    <summary>mission_accomplishment_summary</summary>
  </context_snapshot>
  <resume_instructions>
    <next_step>workflow_complete</next_step>
    <required_context>full_project_context</required_context>
    <validation_required>final_quality_assurance</validation_required>
  </resume_instructions>
</workflow_checkpoint>
```

## Checkpoint Architecture

### 1. Checkpoint Types

#### Phase Boundary Checkpoints
Generated after each major workflow stage (1, 2, 3) to enable resumability.

#### User Approval Checkpoints
Generated when user decision impacts workflow direction:

```xml
<approval_checkpoint>
  <checkpoint_id>workflow_[id]_approval_[decision_point]</checkpoint_id>
  <decision_required>
    <decision_type>architecture_choice|technology_selection|approach_validation</decision_type>
    <options>
      <option id="1" pros="benefits" cons="limitations">approach_description</option>
      <option id="2" pros="benefits" cons="limitations">alternative_approach</option>
    </options>
    <recommendation>preferred_option_with_rationale</recommendation>
  </decision_required>
  <context_for_decision>
    <analysis_complete>research_and_impact_assessment</analysis_complete>
    <trade_offs>detailed_comparison_of_approaches</trade_offs>
    <implications>long_term_consequences_of_choice</implications>
  </context_for_decision>
  <workflow_continuation>
    <on_approval>continue_with_implementation</on_approval>
    <on_rejection>return_to_planning_with_feedback</on_rejection>
    <on_modification>adjust_approach_based_on_input</on_modification>
  </workflow_continuation>
</approval_checkpoint>
```

#### Error Recovery Checkpoints
Generated when workflow encounters blocking issues:

```xml
<error_checkpoint>
  <checkpoint_id>workflow_[id]_error_[error_type]</checkpoint_id>
  <error_context>
    <error_type>permission_denied|dependency_missing|context_overflow|anchor_ambiguity</error_type>
    <error_location>specific_step_or_phase_where_error_occurred</error_location>
    <attempted_resolution>what_was_tried_to_resolve</attempted_resolution>
    <partial_completion>work_completed_before_error</partial_completion>
  </error_context>
  <recovery_strategy>
    <immediate_options>
      <option priority="high">retry_with_adjusted_parameters</option>
      <option priority="medium">escalate_to_specialized_agent</option>
      <option priority="low">request_user_intervention</option>
    </immediate_options>
    <rollback_required>true|false</rollback_required>
    <context_integrity>preserved|needs_reconstruction</context_integrity>
  </recovery_strategy>
  <resume_plan>
    <recovery_steps>specific_actions_to_resolve_error</recovery_steps>
    <validation_steps>how_to_verify_resolution</validation_steps>
    <continuation_point>where_to_resume_workflow</continuation_point>
  </resume_plan>
</error_checkpoint>
```

### 2. Checkpoint Implementation

#### Checkpoint Storage
Store checkpoints using Serena memory system for cross-session persistence:

```
serena_write_memory(
  memory_name="workflow_[id]_checkpoint_[timestamp]",
  content=structured_checkpoint_xml
)
```

#### Context Compression
Minimize checkpoint size while preserving critical information:
- Compress verbose reasoning into bullet outcomes
- Abstract repeated patterns into references
- Maintain complete context for autonomous resumption
- Preserve all critical decisions and constraints

#### Resume Validation Protocol
Before resuming any workflow from checkpoint:

1. **Context Integrity Check**: Validate that all referenced files, decisions, and constraints are still valid
2. **Environment Verification**: Confirm that dependencies, permissions, and platform requirements remain unchanged
3. **Progress Validation**: Verify that completed steps are still in expected state
4. **Agent Capability Check**: Ensure required agents and tools are available for continuation

```xml
<resume_validation>
  <checkpoint_validity>
    <context_current>true|false</context_current>
    <dependencies_available>true|false</dependencies_available>
    <progress_intact>true|false</progress_intact>
    <agent_capabilities>verified|needs_update</agent_capabilities>
  </checkpoint_validity>
  <resume_action>
    <validation_passed>continue_from_checkpoint</validation_passed>
    <validation_failed>reconstruct_context_and_retry</validation_failed>
    <partial_validity>selective_replay_from_last_valid_point</partial_validity>
  </resume_action>
</resume_validation>
```

## Workflow State Management

### 1. Simple Tasks (â‰¤2 steps)
Execute directly; skip checklist & scaffold.

### 2. Complex Tasks (â‰¥3 steps)
Use this protocol end-to-end with mandatory checkpoints.

### 3. State Persistence
- For tasks requiring 4+ steps, the checklist and progress MUST be managed directly in the conversation (chat)
- Workflow: Post markdown checklist â†’ Execute each step â†’ Mark complete â†’ Repeat until done
- Autonomous Execution: Once checklist is posted and approved, agent must autonomously execute the entire plan

### 4. Context Rot-Aware Execution
Enhanced workflow patterns that account for context length impact on LLM performance:

#### Context Length Thresholds
- **Short Context (<500 tokens)**: Standard processing, minimal compression
- **Medium Context (500-2000 tokens)**: Progressive compression, relevance filtering
- **Long Context (2000-5000 tokens)**: Aggressive compression, information restructuring
- **Extended Context (>5000 tokens)**: Maximum compression, critical information only

#### Performance-Based Workflow Adjustments
- **Quality Degradation Detection**: Monitor LLM response quality and adjust context accordingly
- **Adaptive Complexity**: Reduce workflow complexity when context length impacts performance
- **Progressive Information Loading**: Load information incrementally to maintain optimal performance
- **Context Quality Gates**: Validate context quality before major workflow decisions

## Error Recovery and Failure Handling

### 1. Stall Detection
Two consecutive batches without checklist advancement â†’ restart minimal scaffold (retain objective).

### 2. Anchor Integrity
Halt edits until a unique anchor or symbol path is confirmed; expand multi-line context up to 2 times.

### 3. Permission Denial
Narrow file/command scope; retry once; if still denied, surface required permission change.

### 4. Ambiguous Matches
Broaden search (symbol/grep) â‰¤2 iterations; if still non-unique escalate.

### 5. Token Burst Control
If projected AWS growth >15%, perform compression before new large reads.

### 6. Recovery Workflow
- Create error checkpoint with current state
- Implement recovery strategy based on error type
- Validate recovery before resuming
- Update checkpoint with recovery actions

## Integration Guidelines

### 1. Context Management Integration
- Apply unified context protocol compression during workflows
- Use optimized context formats for workflow steps
- Monitor context quality throughout workflow execution
- Implement context-aware workflow decisions

### 2. Agent Specialization Integration
- Route workflow steps to specialized agents when appropriate
- Use agent-specific context optimization
- Enable parallel execution by specialized agents
- Monitor workflow performance by agent type

### 3. Security Integration
- Apply security validation at each workflow stage
- Include security checkpoints in verification phase
- Implement secure checkpoint storage and retrieval
- Audit workflow decisions for security compliance
