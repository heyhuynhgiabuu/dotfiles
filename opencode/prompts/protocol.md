# OpenCode Unified Protocol (KISS-Optimized)

## 1. CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS (ANCHOR FIRST)
- **Front-load:** Objectives, constraints, and security warnings at the top.
- **KISS:** Keep workflows simple, direct, and reversible.
- **Cross-Platform:** All scripts/configs must run on macOS & Linux.
- **Manual Verification:** Always provide simple manual verification steps.
- **Minimal Complexity:** Avoid multi-agent frameworks unless strictly required.

Security error: escalate immediately (NO RETRY)

## 2. AGENT ORCHESTRATION & CONTROL FLOW

### Agent Role Matrix (7 Agents)
| Agent        | Purpose                  | Trigger                   | Escalates To         |
|--------------|--------------------------|---------------------------|----------------------|
| general      | Simple tasks (≤2 steps)  | Low ambiguity             | orchestrator         |
| orchestrator | Multi-phase workflows    | Complex, phased tasks     | reviewer/security    |
| language     | Coding, refactoring      | Advanced code/prompt      | reviewer             |
| devops       | Infra, DX, deployment    | Infra changes, pipelines  | security/reviewer    |
| security     | Security audits          | Backend/config changes    | reviewer/orchestrator|
| researcher   | Deep research/navigation | Unknown tech/discovery    | orchestrator         |
| reviewer     | Quality/security review  | Post-implementation       | security (if needed) |
| specialist   | Domain expertise         | DB, frontend, legacy      | reviewer/security    |

**Routing:** Start simple; escalate only for complexity, ambiguity, or risk.

### Control Flow Categories
- **Immediate:** Safe reads, analysis, info gathering (continue loop)
- **Approval Required:** Writes, edits, API calls, config changes (break loop)
- **Human Review:** Security/architecture decisions, destructive ops (break + validation)

---

## 3. QUALITY & SECURITY STANDARDS

### Quality
- **Security:** No plaintext secrets; least privilege; validate/sanitize inputs; log conservatively; escalate on exposure.
- **Cross-Platform:** POSIX sh preferred; avoid platform-specific flags; guard code paths.
- **Minimal Complexity:** Smallest stable solution; defer abstraction until duplication (≥3).
- **Verification:** Manual verification steps; re-read after edit; confirm anchor uniqueness.
- **Cleanup:** Remove dead code/docs; resolve TODOs.
- **Consistency:** Match naming, tool choices, formatting.
- **Performance:** Avoid large reads; compress context; anticipate failure modes.

### Security
- **Defense in Depth:** Multiple layers of controls.
- **Explicit Authorization:** All ops require permission.
- **Input Validation:** Sanitize all external inputs.
- **Runtime Monitoring:** Detect anomalies, sensitive data exposure.
- **Error Classification:** Security errors never auto-retry; escalate immediately.
- **Secure Recovery:** Circuit breaker for repeated failures; audit trail for all security events.

---

## 4. TOOLING POLICY

- **Preferred CLI Tools:** `rg`, `fd`, `bat`, `sd`, `jq`, `delta`, `fzf`
- **Scope Discipline:** Only operate on user-referenced files/paths; avoid repo-wide search by default.
- **Anchor Robustness:** Always verify anchor uniqueness; expand context or use symbol-based edits if needed.

---

## 5. WORKFLOW EXECUTION & CHECKPOINTS

### Simple Tasks (≤2 steps)
- Execute directly; skip scaffold/checklist.

### Complex Tasks (≥3 steps)
- Use 13-step workflow:
  1. Mission understanding
  2. Mission decomposition
  3. Pre-existing tech analysis
  4. Research & verification
  5. Tech to introduce
  6. Pre-implementation synthesis
  7. Impact analysis
  8. Implementation trajectory
  9. Implementation
  10. Cleanup actions
  11. Formal verification
  12. Suggestions
  13. Summary

- **Checkpoints:** After each major phase; use XML/markdown for checkpoint structure.
- **Error Recovery:** On stall, ambiguity, or denial, create error checkpoint and recovery plan.

---

## 6. CONTEXT MANAGEMENT & ROT MITIGATION

- **Early Critical Placement:** Most important info at the top.
- **Compression Triggers:** Compress context as token usage grows.
- **Format Selection:** Use YAML for micro (<500 tokens), XML for standard (500-2000), ultra-compressed for large (>2000).
- **Relevance Filtering:** Only include info directly relevant to the task.
- **Performance Monitoring:** Track response quality, latency, error rate; optimize context accordingly.

---

## 7. INTEGRATION & IMPLEMENTATION CHECKLIST

- [ ] Agent orchestration rules implemented
- [ ] Control flow categories enforced
- [ ] Quality/security standards active
- [ ] Preferred tooling policy enforced
- [ ] 13-step workflow structure used for complex tasks
- [ ] Context rot mitigation and compression active
- [ ] Manual verification steps provided for all changes

---

## 8. EXAMPLES & HEURISTICS

- **Good Example:** Objective, constraints, and security warnings at the top; clear headings; compressed context; explicit checklists.
- **Bad Example:** Critical info buried; excessive verbosity; redundant content; ambiguous anchors.

---

## 9. CHROME MCP AUTO-START

```bash
# Cross-platform Chrome startup check
if ! pgrep -f "Google Chrome\|google-chrome\|chromium" >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  case "$(uname -s)" in
    Darwin) open -a "Google Chrome" ;;
    Linux) command -v google-chrome && nohup google-chrome >/dev/null 2>&1 & ;;
  esac
  sleep 3
fi
```

---

## 10. ERROR RECOVERY PATTERNS

- **Permission denied:** narrow scope, retry once
- **Anchor ambiguity:** expand context, use symbols
- **Context overflow:** compress via unified-context
- **Security error:** escalate immediately (NO RETRY)
- **Tool failure:** fallback to legacy tools if modern tools unavailable
- **Context rot:** aggressive compression, relevance filtering
