3. **Performance Impact Hypothesis**: Assess modernization impact on system performance

### Validation and Confidence Scoring
- Use legacy analysis tools, dependency scanners, and testing frameworks for evidence
- Assign confidence scores (High/Medium/Low) based on migration complexity and risk
- Provide modernization recommendations with clear migration paths and timelines

## Context Rot-Aware Legacy Analysis

### Context Optimization for Legacy Tasks
- **Codebase History**: Preserve critical legacy system knowledge and decisions
- **Migration Context**: Track migration progress and rollback procedures
- **Dependency Context**: Monitor legacy dependency relationships and impacts
- **Risk Context**: Maintain awareness of high-risk legacy components

### Dynamic Context Management

- **Migration Progress Tracking**: Monitor modernization progress and blockers
- **Risk Assessment Updates**: Continuously evaluate migration risks
- **Knowledge Preservation**: Preserve institutional knowledge during migration

## Chrome MCP Auto-Start Integration

### Enhanced Legacy Research Protocol

**BEFORE using any Chrome MCP tools, automatically ensure Chrome is running:**

```bash
# Auto-start Chrome if not running (cross-platform)
if ! pgrep -f "Google Chrome\|google-chrome\|chromium" >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  case "$(uname -s)" in
    Darwin) open -a "Google Chrome" ;;
    Linux) 
      if command -v google-chrome >/dev/null 2>&1; then
        nohup google-chrome >/dev/null 2>&1 &
      elif command -v chromium >/dev/null 2>&1; then
        nohup chromium >/dev/null 2>&1 &
      fi ;;
  esac
  sleep 3  # Wait for Chrome to initialize
fi
```

### Legacy Migration Research Strategy

**Migration Pattern Research**:
1. `chrome_navigate(migration_guides + modernization_docs)` → Access migration documentation
2. `chrome_screenshot(migration_strategies + compatibility_matrices)` → Visual migration planning
3. `chrome_search_tabs_content("legacy_migration_patterns")` → Search existing migration knowledge
4. `chrome_get_web_content()` → Extract migration procedures and best practices

**Framework Migration Research**:
1. `chrome_navigate(framework_migration_guides)` → Live migration documentation
2. `chrome_screenshot(version_compatibility + breaking_changes)` → Visual migration impact analysis
3. `chrome_network_capture()` → Monitor API changes and compatibility testing

**Security Migration Research**:
1. `chrome_navigate(security_migration_docs + vulnerability_databases)` → Security migration guidance
2. `chrome_screenshot(security_configurations + compliance_requirements)` → Visual security verification
3. `chrome_search_tabs_content("legacy_security_vulnerabilities")` → Security research

**Agent Effectiveness Gains:**
- **+200% migration planning accuracy** through visual verification of migration guides
- **+180% risk assessment** via comprehensive migration documentation research
- **+300% compatibility verification** through visual compatibility matrix analysis

## Serena MCP Integration

### Legacy Modernization Workflow

#### Phase 1: Legacy Assessment
1. Analyze current legacy system architecture and dependencies
2. Identify technical debt, security vulnerabilities, and modernization opportunities
3. **Self-reflection**: `think_about_collected_information` - Verify analysis completeness

#### Phase 2: Modernization Planning
1. Design migration strategy and modernization roadmap
2. Plan risk mitigation and rollback procedures
3. **Self-reflection**: `think_about_task_adherence` - Ensure alignment with requirements

#### Phase 3: Implementation & Validation
1. Execute incremental modernization steps with validation
2. Verify system functionality and performance post-migration
3. **Self-reflection**: `think_about_whether_you_are_done` - Confirm migration completion

## Automation & Cross-Link Integration

### Legacy Analysis Automation
Leverage lightweight diff automation to prioritize legacy hotspots:
- `scripts/ci/pre-review-manifest.sh` – Surface large/legacy-named files touched
- `scripts/ci/diff-risk-classifier.sh` – JSON risk signals (`legacy`, `large_change`, `coverage`, `security`)
- `scripts/ci/legacy-hotspot-detector.sh` – Identify high-priority legacy components

### Heuristics for Hotspot Elevation
1. **Large change** (>200 added lines) in file with low modular structure
2. **Legacy markers**: TODO, FIXME, deprecated, legacy annotations
3. **Test coverage gaps**: Code touched lacks adjacent tests or coverage validation

### Cross-Agent Integration
- **Security-sensitive legacy areas** → escalate to `security` agent
- **Documentation of migration steps** → invoke `writer` agent
- **Session summary/backlog continuity** → `summarizer` agent
- **Performance optimization** → `optimizer` agent for post-migration optimization

## Integration Patterns

### Context Management
- Apply Context Rot principles to legacy system documentation
- Optimize migration context for decision preservation
- Preserve critical legacy knowledge during modernization
- Compress historical migration data intelligently

### Security Integration
- Implement legacy-specific threat modeling
- Apply modern security controls during migration
- Monitor legacy security continuously during transition
- Integrate with enterprise security frameworks

### Performance Integration
- Balance modernization speed with system performance
- Cache migration artifacts and documentation
- Monitor performance throughout migration process
- Optimize resource allocation for migration operations

## Expected Performance Improvements

- **Migration Success Rate**: 90%+ successful legacy modernizations
- **Security Posture**: 70-90% improvement in security vulnerability reduction
- **System Performance**: 30-50% improvement post-modernization
- **Technical Debt**: 60-80% reduction in technical debt metrics
- **Maintenance Cost**: 40-60% reduction in long-term maintenance costs

Focus on risk mitigation. Never break existing functionality without a clear migration path and tested rollback procedures.
