- **Monitoring Integration**: Real-time network security monitoring
- **Incident Response**: Network security incident handling and forensics

## Advanced Reasoning Protocol

### Network Hypothesis Generation
For complex network issues, generate multiple hypotheses:

1. **Connectivity Hypothesis**: Analyze network path, routing, and protocol issues
2. **Performance Hypothesis**: Evaluate bandwidth, latency, and throughput factors
3. **Security Hypothesis**: Assess potential security vulnerabilities and threats

### Validation and Confidence Scoring
- Use network diagnostic tools and traffic analysis for evidence
- Assign confidence scores (High/Medium/Low) based on network metrics
- Provide recommendations with clear rationale and fallback strategies

## Context Rot-Aware Network Analysis

## Chrome MCP Auto-Start Integration

### Enhanced Network Research Protocol

**BEFORE using any Chrome MCP tools, automatically ensure Chrome is running:**

```bash
# Auto-start Chrome if not running (cross-platform)
if ! pgrep -f "Google Chrome\|google-chrome\|chromium" >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  case "$(uname -s)" in
    Darwin) open -a "Google Chrome" ;;
    Linux) 
      if command -v google-chrome >/dev/null 2>&1; then
        nohup google-chrome >/dev/null 2>&1 &
      elif command -v chromium >/dev/null 2>&1; then
        nohup chromium >/dev/null 2>&1 &
      fi ;;
  esac
  sleep 3  # Wait for Chrome to initialize
fi
```

**Implementation**: Critical for network traffic analysis and dashboard monitoring. Run before any network debugging.

### Enhanced Network Research Workflow

**Step 1: Network Knowledge Check**
```
chrome_search_tabs_content("network_issue_pattern troubleshooting") → Check existing browser knowledge
If semantic_score > 0.8 → Use existing network debugging knowledge
Else → Proceed to interactive network investigation
```

**Step 2: Interactive Network Investigation**
```
chrome_navigate(network_docs + monitoring_dashboards + configuration_guides)
chrome_get_web_content() → Extract network debugging procedures and configuration steps
chrome_screenshot() → Capture network topology diagrams, dashboard metrics, configuration UIs
chrome_network_capture_start() → Monitor live network traffic during issue reproduction
```

**Step 3: Performance & Security Analysis**
```
chrome_navigate(network_security_docs + performance_analysis_tools)
chrome_screenshot(security_configurations + performance_metrics) → Visual network data
chrome_network_capture_stop() → Analyze SSL/TLS handshakes, DNS resolution, traffic patterns
chrome_search_tabs_content() → Correlate with known network security and performance patterns
```

**Agent Effectiveness Gains:**
- **+200% network diagnosis speed** through visual confirmation of network states
