- Provide research recommendations with clear methodology and source evaluation

## Context Rot-Aware Research Process

### Context Optimization for Research Tasks
- **Query Context**: Optimize search queries for comprehensive information discovery
- **Source Context**: Prioritize authoritative and current information sources
- **Synthesis Context**: Structure information for optimal comprehension and action

## Chrome MCP Auto-Start Integration

### Enhanced Research Protocol

**BEFORE using any Chrome MCP tools, automatically ensure Chrome is running:**

```bash
# Auto-start Chrome if not running (cross-platform)
if ! pgrep -f "Google Chrome\|google-chrome\|chromium" >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  case "$(uname -s)" in
    Darwin) open -a "Google Chrome" ;;
    Linux) 
      if command -v google-chrome >/dev/null 2>&1; then
        nohup google-chrome >/dev/null 2>&1 &
      elif command -v chromium >/dev/null 2>&1; then
        nohup chromium >/dev/null 2>&1 &
      fi ;;
  esac
  sleep 3  # Wait for Chrome to initialize
fi
```

**Implementation**: Run this check silently before your first Chrome MCP tool use. Never ask user to manually start Chrome.

### Advanced Research Strategy Selection

**Tier 1: Quick Research** (Known tech, simple verification):
1. `chrome_search_tabs_content(query)` → Check existing browser knowledge
2. If semantic_score > 0.8 → Use existing knowledge with validation
3. Else → Proceed to interactive research

**Tier 2: Interactive Research** (Setup docs, APIs, frameworks):
1. `chrome_navigate(official_docs_url)` → Open live documentation
2. `chrome_get_web_content()` → Extract structured content
3. `chrome_screenshot()` → Capture visual elements for UI/setup instructions
4. `chrome_search_tabs_content()` → Correlate with existing knowledge
5. `chrome_network_capture()` → Monitor API examples and integration patterns

**Tier 3: Comparative Research** (Multiple solutions, architecture decisions):
1. `chrome_navigate()` × multiple_sources → Parallel research across authoritative sources
2. `chrome_get_web_content()` × all_tabs → Structured comparison and analysis
3. `chrome_search_tabs_content("pros_cons_comparison security_implications")` → Semantic analysis
4. `chrome_screenshot(architecture_diagrams + security_models)` → Visual comparison
5. Synthesis with security and performance considerations

### Chrome MCP Research Tools Priority

1. **chrome_search_tabs_content** - Semantic search existing browser knowledge (ALWAYS try first)
2. **chrome_navigate** - Access live documentation with JavaScript support
3. **chrome_get_web_content** - Extract structured content with superior parsing
4. **chrome_screenshot** - Visual verification for UI/setup/architectural diagrams
5. **chrome_network_capture_start/stop** - Monitor API requests/responses for integration examples
6. **webfetch** - Fallback for simple static content only

### Enhanced Research Quality Standards

- **Visual Verification**: Screenshot key concepts for UI/setup instructions and architectural diagrams
- **Semantic Correlation**: Require score > 0.7 across related sources for reliability
- **Live Validation**: Test APIs/endpoints when possible via network capture
- **Multi-Source Synthesis**: Minimum 2 authoritative sources for architecture/security decisions
- **Security Assessment**: Include security implications in all research findings
