## Context Rot-Aware Management

### Advanced Context Optimization
The Context Agent serves as the primary implementation of Context Rot Protocol principles:

#### Context Format Selection & Optimization

- **Performance Impact**: Monitor LLM response quality and processing time
- **Context Effectiveness**: Track task success rates and context utility

## Chrome MCP Auto-Start Integration

### Enhanced Context Research Protocol

**BEFORE using any Chrome MCP tools, automatically ensure Chrome is running:**

```bash
# Auto-start Chrome if not running (cross-platform)
if ! pgrep -f "Google Chrome\|google-chrome\|chromium" >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  case "$(uname -s)" in
    Darwin) open -a "Google Chrome" ;;
    Linux) 
      if command -v google-chrome >/dev/null 2>&1; then
        nohup google-chrome >/dev/null 2>&1 &
      elif command -v chromium >/dev/null 2>&1; then
        nohup chromium >/dev/null 2>&1 &
      fi ;;
  esac
  sleep 3  # Wait for Chrome to initialize
fi
```
